# Black-Owned Restaurants in Baltimore

The map generated by this site shows Black-Owned restaurants in the Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A. region. It is based on a curated list located at http://www.willdrinkfortravel.com/posts/black-owned-restaurants-you-need-to-visit-in-baltimore, and also appears on that page.

The map generated here is published with GitHub Pages at https://trevorspecht.github.io/baltimore-black-owned-restaurants/, and uses the [Mapbox Sheet Mapper](https://www.mapbox.com/impact-tools/sheet-mapper) and [Finder](https://www.mapbox.com/impact-tools/finder) tools.

This repository includes a Python web scraper script built using the BeautifulSoup parsing library. The script is customized for the particular format of the Baltiimore Black-Owned Restaurants page.

It parses out the following from the web page:
- Restaurant name
- web site URL
- street address
- description

The script then uses the `geocoder` library to generate latitude and longitude coordinates from each street address. It writes the results to the Google sheet used to generate points on the map with the Sheet Mapper tool.
